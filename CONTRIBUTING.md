# How to contribute to knock_once
Thank you for considering a contribution to knock_once! This gem is still very young and needs a lot of things. Below you will find a few guides. Please do also make sure that your interactions on this project follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/nicholasshirley/knock_once/code_of_conduct.md).

# Test coverage
Currently test coverage is weak. If you have experience testing engines using RSpec, your contribution in this area would be very much appreciated! The current strategy is to use the dummy app to mirror a fresh install of an app with knoc_once included, however, I'm open to changing this if there is a better way to test. If you have input in this area, please open an issue so we can discuss.

# Sending pull requests
The goal of knock_once is to provide basic JWT authentication that is useful to a large number of projects and easy to extend. If you have a new feature you would like to work on, please open an issue to discuss. At the moment, there are many things that the gem doesn't do and it's very likely that you can contribute something useful in this area, but it's always a good idea to post just to make sure that your time is well spent.

If adding new features/functionality, please include tests with your PR. If refactoring code, please make sure that the current tests pass.

# Contributing to the docs
At the moment all the documentation for this project lives in the readme. I've tried my best to make it as clear as possible on setting up knock_once on a new project, but I'm sure that there are many areas where this can be improved. 

# Personal note
I haven't been coding for that long and this is my first gem. I'm positive that there are many very basic improvements which can be made to this gem. If you have the time, a PR would aweseome, but if you don't and you see something that can be improved, feel free to open an issue. All constructive feedback is very welcome.
